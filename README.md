## _(February 2021)_
Final Homework of the Neural Networks for Data Science Applications exam

Goals: 
- implenting a classifier on a image dataset of handwritten digits
- attacking the model in different ways 
- training the model on the attacked data to make it more robust to future perturbations

Tools: Python, Keras Tensorflow,Adversial Robustness Toolbox
